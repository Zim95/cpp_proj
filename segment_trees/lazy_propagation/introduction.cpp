/*
    Lazy propagation in segment trees
    ---------------------------------
    Optimization to do Range updates in segment trees in O(LogN) time.
    As we saw, normally range updates take O(N) time.

    Idea:
    -----
    Postpone the updates to the descendant of the node until the
    node needs to be accessed. (Lazy propagation).
