    Question:
    =========
    Count binary strings of length N, which have no consecutive ones?

    Answer:
    =======
    So the problem says, count all binary strings that have no consecutive ones.
    Suppose N=3.
    000
    001
    010
    011 - Consecutive one
    100
    101
    110 - Consecutive one
    111 - Consecutive one
    ----
    3 consecutive one binary strings.
    So total binary strings with no consecutive ones - (7-3) = 4.
